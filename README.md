A hobby-centric social media application

## About

[Webby](https://webby-social.netlify.app) is a networking app that allows users to view a web themselves and other users, connected through their specific interests. Users can look through their own web and check out other user's information, choose to add them as a friend and send them a message to plan a meetup. Webby supports individual chats as well as group chats to plan larger meetups. The goal of this application is to help people build their communities and make connections with other people through things they might be passionate about, or want to learn.

This project was created with create-react-app, as the capstone project for the Grace Hopper program at FullStack Academy.
